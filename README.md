Bella Otér Archetype Selector

I made a simple single-page app where users select what their body craves today and get shown a matching product.

Time spent: About 3 hours

What I’d improve with more time:

Add animations when switching views

Improve mobile responsiveness

Use real product images or custom icons

Add more polished styling and colors

Make it more accessible with keyboard support
